    <h3>History of Corn:
    </h3>
    <p>Corn was first naturalized by the people of Mexico about 10,000 years ago! They grounded, cooked, and processed corn through Nixtalization. Read moore about Nixtalization here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization Corn is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas. 85% of the corn grown in the US is genetically modified. 40% of that corn is used to make corn oil or ethanol. Corn was spread around the world fast because it could grow in a diverse set climates.
